# 8-Bit-LFSR
- 8 Bit LFSR in Proteus
- This project is a 8-bit Synchronous Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) used as an Encryption device.

## About 
This project is an 8-bit Linear Feedback Shift Register, which is used as a password Encryptor/Decryptor.

The project is designed and implemented by myself. This project is the final project of the _Digital Design Lab_ course, under supervision of [Dr.Farshad Khun-jush](linkedin.com/in/farshad-khun-jush-785b93191) at Shiraz University.

## How It Works
you give 8 bits of data and 8 bits of key to a LFSF module which works with clock and gives you an encrypted 8-bit data after 10 clock pulses ( you can change the clock pulse limit but it must be more than 8 clocks at least .)
The project is divided into two parts ( labeled in the main page as Encryption & Decryption ).
